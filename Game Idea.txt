Theme: Overpowered
Idea: Mini RPG

- The game starts as any other RPG would: the player wakes up in a cave equipped with nothing
- They find a not-so-secret room where they equip a sword that does infinite damage and armor that prevents them from taking damage
- The player plays through 2-3 bounty hunter missions with ease before facing a final boss
- The final boss is defeated in one hit
- The game ends with the player looking around confused like "Is that it?" before cutting to black with the text "Yup."
